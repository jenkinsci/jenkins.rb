Feature: Show build details
  I want to see details about a particular build for a job I'm interested in

  Scenario: Show build details for a job on a non-existent server (jenkins build_details)
    When I run local executable "jenkins" with arguments "build_details ruby 1 --host localhost --port 9999"
    Then I should see exactly
      """
      No connection available to the server.
      """

    And the Jenkins server has no current jobs
    When I run local executable "jenkins" with arguments "build_details ruby 1 --host localhost --port 3010"
    Then I should see exactly
      """
      ERROR: Cannot find project 'ruby'.
      """
